# Million-Song-Database-Datamining
The aim of this project was to use the data provided by the Million Song Dataset http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/ to determine what attributes of a song made it popular

The data had to be converted to csv so it was usable, the next step was to clean the data so all unusable rows were removed. 
The data was then examined using Java.

Here's the report of our findings(an example of the data used is in here): https://github.com/EoghanMcMullen/Million-Song-Database-Datamining/blob/master/Group20Report.pdf

Here's the main java file which was run on the cleaned CSV file
Please note: Java was not ideal for this project as we learnt while coding.
